<p>Summary: This text is a declaration that explains why a group of people feels the need to separate from another political entity. It asserts that all men are created equal and have certain natural rights, such as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. It states that governments are established to secure these rights and that when a government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it and establish a new one. The text also argues that long-established governments should not be changed for trivial reasons, but when a government consistently abuses its power and seeks to establish absolute rule, it is the duty of the people to overthrow it. The text suggests that the present King of Great Britain has committed numerous injurious acts and usurpations to establish tyranny over the states, and it requests that these facts be presented to the world. </p><p>Originial: When, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth that separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind require that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, that to secure these rights governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, that whenever any form of government becomes destructive of those ends, it is the right of the people to alter or abolish it, and to institute new government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form as to them shall seem most likely to affect their safety and happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes, and accordingly all experience hath shown that mankind are more disposed to suffer which evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed, but when a long train of abusers and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object, invents a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such government and to provide new guards for their future security. Such has been the patient sufferance of these colonies, and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute tyranny over these states. To prove this, let facts be submitted to a candid world.</p>
